2.0 Define a Java class named `NumberCruncher` that has a single `int` variable as its only instance variable. Then define methods that perform the following operations on its number: `get`, `double`, `triple`, `square`, and `cube`. Set the initial value of the number with a `constructor`.  
Write a main() method and add it to the NumberCruncher class. Use it to create a NumberCruncher instance, with a certain initial value, and then get it to report its double, triple,square, and cube.

EXERCISE 2.19 Write a Java class definition for a Cube object, that has an inte-
ger attribute for the length of its side. The object should be capable of reporting
its surface area and volume. The surface area of a cube is six times the area of any
side. The volume is calculated by cubing the side.
EXERCISE 2.20 Write a Java class definition for a CubeUser object that will use
the Cube object defined in the previous exercise. This class should create three
Cube instances, each with a different side, and then report their respective surface
areas and volumes.
EXERCISE 2.21 Challenge: Modify your solution to the previous exercise so
that it lets the user input the side of the cube. Follow the example shown in this
chapter’s “From the Java Library” section.CHAPTER 2 •

EXERCISE 2.22 Challenge: Define a Java class that represents an address book
entry, Entry, which consists of a name, address, and phone number, all repre-
sented as Strings. For the class’s interface, define methods to set and get the
values of each of its instance variables. Thus, for the name variable, it should have
a setName() and a getName() method.
