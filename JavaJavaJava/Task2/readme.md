2.0 Define a Java class named `NumberCruncher` that has a single `int` variable as its only instance variable. Then define methods that perform the following operations on its number: `get`, `double`, `triple`, `square`, and `cube`. Set the initial value of the number with a `constructor`.  
Write a main() method and add it to the NumberCruncher class. Use it to create a NumberCruncher instance, with a certain initial value, and then get it to report its double, triple,square, and cube.

2.1 Write a Java class definition for a `Cube object`, that has an integer attribute for the `length` of its side. The object should be capable of reporting its `surface area` and `volume`. The surface area of a cube is *six times the area of any side*. The volume is calculated by *cubing the side*.  
Write a Java class definition for a `CubeUser object` that will use the Cube object. This class should create three Cube instances, each with a different side that the user will input, and then report their respective surface areas and volumes.

2.2 Define a Java class that represents an address book entry, `Entry`, which consists of a `name`, `address`, and `phone number`, all represented as `Strings`. For the classâ€™s interface, define methods to `set` and `get` the values of each of its instance variables. Thus, for the name variable, it should have a `setName()` and a `getName()` method.
